      <img src="Images/profile2.jpg" alt="Hi, My name is Maria Jose Velasco" width="200" style="float: right;">
      <p>My name is Maria Jose, I'm from San Miguel de los Bancos, I love to read and write. I'm the fourth of six brothers. As a child, I lived on a farm surrounded by animals and a variety of plants.</p>
      <p>The most enjoyable part of my childhood was playing with my brothers until nightfall.</p>
      <p>My love for nature led me to become an Agricultural Engineer. However, my reality has changed; I now live with my husband in the USA and have gained some knowledge about technology. I find this world amazing and I'm eager to contribute my expertise in this field. It's a great challenge in my life, but with God's blessings, I hope to achieve it in the future.</p>
      <p>For all those reasons I enjoy nature. I love camping and swimming. My birthday is in July, and I am a Leo.</p>
      <p>Finally, I have the desire to learn about computers and technology.</p>
